I was thinking about getting a bookshelf but I don't have many books yet so I guest I can wait I was lucky I got a really cheap used TV the other day It only cost 50 dollars and it works really well It's nice to have something to watch Right now I don't have enough money to buy a stereo The dinner table is very nice and big enough for six people I bought a cheap sofa too It's really comfortable
