So when you come out of the subway look for a tall glass building That's a hotel Walk past that for two blocks and you'll see a small street on the right That's my street There's a grocery store on the corner Go down the street and my place is the fourth house on the left Maybe bring some CDs with you because I don't have any dance music for the party
