I don't like jogging or doing anything too energetic I prefer taking walks I like to take a short walk every day through the park across from my house Sometimes my boyfriend goes with me It's nice to talk and look at the flowers and trees On Sunday I like to swim but for only about a half hour I sleep the rest of the weekend
