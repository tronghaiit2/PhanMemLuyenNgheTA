I am a big football fan but I only watch it on TV I can't stand playing it There are great games to watch on the weekend I also enjoy watching tennis I'd like to learn someday but I don't like to sweat I love chess and often play with my younger sister She's really good at it and usually wins On the weekends I love to play video games with some of my friends
