I enjoy exercise but I don’t do it as much as I should 
I meet a friend every Wednesday and we play tennis 
I’m not a very good player but it’s fun and we usually play for an hour 
On weekends I like to bicycle in our neighborhood 
I guess I spend an hour or two doing that 
Oh and I love baseball but only watching it while sitting on the couch eating popcorn
